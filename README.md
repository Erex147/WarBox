# Next update:
* Gun soldier spawning
* ~~Fix annoying ui bug (hopefully)~~ can't fix just yet
* More Units - APC, IFV, Self propelled artillery
* Visual improvements
* Code refactors

# Ideas
* Propaganda tower: inspires all units in a city
* Airport: produces airplanes
* ATC: upgrade for airport, allows higher tier planes.
* Nuclear silo: launches nukes,  (provided it has resources, very expensive)
* Naval base: produces warships
